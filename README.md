# Introduction to Perl 6

This is a talk I am giving to a local group of techs called flinthills.io. I am
uploading the slides here for their reference.

All of the code here has been posted to glot.io to make it easy for them to try
out in a browser:

To install and run these locally, visit the Perl 6 web site and click on the
**Download Rakudo Perl 6** and follow the instructions:

For some additional talks that are most certainly better than mine, the first
two being intros like my talk and the two by Michaud being tutorials that
introduce language features in a way that can help you start to use it:

* Curtis “Ovid” Poe, [Perl 6 — Why People Are So
  Excited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9UdvxMAbo) at FOSDEM ‘16
* Damian Conway, [On the Shoulders of
  Giants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq2HkAYbG5o) at The Perl Conference,
